# 100daysofcode
My #the100dayproject code project. 

The goal is to code something -- anything -- for 100 days straight. It's about the process. About letting go of perfectionism and seeing what you can actually accomplish in 100 days. It's a journey. Baby steps. 

It's hard as hell not to be perfectionist about the design. But it's not about that. It's about the code. So here goes.

This is a learning experience. And if you see something that I could be doing in a different/better way, I'd love the feedback.
