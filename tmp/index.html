          <p>Today my awesome coworker <a href="http://cronfu.com/">Jimmy Thai</a> helped me get to the bottom of my Heroku issue. One major reason for the errors was that I had forgotten to add _  before some of my partial Sass files. That was making the code run twice and was causing an undefined variable error. Noted!</p>
          
          <p>He also explained that Heroku wasn't really the best home for a static site like this. So, we moved my site over to Github pages.</p>

          <p>I forgot to add this blog post on Saturday…</p>
          
          <p>Today I added a header and started styling the nav and footers. Not much style, but I started thinking about things and getting stuff organized. I also better organized my CSS. For some reason it appears that when I merged my day-20 branch in Github, it reverted some of my changes. Weird. Adding them back in now. I need to figure out what happened with that…</p>

          <p>Yes! ERB to HAML complete! It's amazing how one little misplaced comma or wrong indentation can ruin it all. Aaaaand, I also learned… when in doubt, bounce dat server!</p>

          <p>Welp, Danilo helped me figure out what was causing the error with my footer conversion from ERB to HAML: a comma. One measly comma. But honestly, I was pretty damn proud of myself that I got that close on my own.</p>
          
          <p>AND THEN… emboldened by my near success, I took on the layout.erb file and tried to convert it to HAML. Stuck again! This time, when I consulted the converter and copied and pasted in that code, it still didn't work! Grrrr. To be continued…</p>

          </h2>
          <p>Today I tried to convert some footer code from Ruby to HAML. I got so so close. But still no cigar. I'll figure it out soon. I'm actually really proud of myself for getting this far. I didn't use a converter or anything! I read the HAML docs and tried to figure it out on my own. 90% there… (I did try a converter after I kept getting an error 100 times trying different things, but it didn't really tell me anything I hadn't already figured out.)</p>
          
          <p>Yesterday my coworker Jimmy helped me understand Ruby a little better. He also helped me understand why my nested layouts weren't working: it WAS working, just not on the page I was expecting it to work on. Derp.</p>

          <p>Today I had a really great front-end dev meeting with Danilo and Jason (our other design/front-enders.) Ignite is going to be slowly giving me more coding projects (YAY!) and so they wanted to talk about code reviews and being consistent across the team so that any of us can jump into anyone else's code and get to work. So we worked out a semantic structure that we'll be using moving forward. I'm so excited to get to learn from their code and have them start reviewing mine to make sure I'm doing things the best way I can be. I love my team so hard. :)</p>
          
          <p>I also learned how to make pull requests in Github. And adjust some structure stuff to make this project more consistent with the above mentioned structure.</p>

          <p>So today, I finally fixed the issue with not being able to push to Heroku. It took forever! For some reason it was saying that <code>$black</code> was undefined even though it was clearly defined in my <code>_variables.sass</code> file and that file was clearly imported correctly in front of my global.css.sass file. Massive thanks again to Danilo, who helped me check everything. Even he agreed after looking over everything that there's no reason for it to be giving an error. Sooooo, I ended up just working around it. Since there wasn't much code in my global.css.sass file anyway (I had only created it to try and be more modular with my css), I decided to just get rid of the file and put that code into the main body of my all.css.sass file. Error fixed. Sheesh.</p>
          
          <p>That said, I really do hate not understanding the reason for the error, if you have any thoughts, shoot me an <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#097;&#109;&#098;&#101;&#114;&#046;&#097;&#117;&#108;&#116;&#109;&#097;&#110;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">email</a> or comment on <a href="http://bit.ly/ambergithub">Github</a>.</p>
