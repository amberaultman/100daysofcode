          <p>So today, I finally fixed the issue with not being able to push to Heroku. It took forever! For some reason it was saying that <code>$black</code> was undefined even though it was clearly defined in my <code>_variables.sass</code> file and that file was clearly imported correctly in front of my global.css.sass file. Massive thanks again to Danilo, who helped me check everything. Even he agreed after looking over everything that there's no reason for it to be giving an error. Sooooo, I ended up just working around it. Since there wasn't much code in my global.css.sass file anyway (I had only created it to try and be more modular with my css), I decided to just get rid of the file and put that code into the main body of my all.css.sass file. Error fixed. Sheesh.</p>
          
          <p>That said, I really do hate not understanding the reason for the error, if you have any thoughts, shoot me an <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#097;&#109;&#098;&#101;&#114;&#046;&#097;&#117;&#108;&#116;&#109;&#097;&#110;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">email</a> or comment on <a href="http://bit.ly/ambergithub">Github</a>.</p>

          <p>God bless <a href="http://www.daniloquilaton.com/">Danilo Quilaton</a>! He helped me understand some of the stuff I've been struggling with (like restarting the Middleman server when you make path changes.) I'm about halfway done with updating the articles with my old posts.</p>
          
          <p>Oh! And I learned a little Markdown language today too! Middleman uses Markdown for they're blog posts. They say you can use any language. Maybe I'll change it to HAML eventually. But I seem to remember reading somewhere that Markdown is better than HAML for content. If you have an opinion either way, let me know!</p>

          <p>Today was more of the same. Still struggling to understand this blogging code. I'm looking forward to being back in the office so that I can bug my awesome coworkers to help me understand. ;)</p>
          
          <p>I made a few other organizational changes. Nothing major though.</p>

          </h2>
          <p>So today I installed the Middleman blogging gem. And woah, buddy do I have a lot to learn. I was pretty overwhelmed once I saw all the Ruby files that it created. I spent the hour picking through the files trying to understand what's there and how it's all linked together, but I'm still pretty confused. I left the site pretty unkept today, so I didn't end up deploying to Heroku today, but you can see the changes on Github. To be continued…</p>

          <p>I owned the timeline today! Man, it felt good. Today I worked from the <a href="http://2016.leanuxnyc.co/">Lean UX conference</a> in NYC. Such a great venue. Although, I've gotta admit, it's hard trying to code and listen at the same time. Note to self: you're not a good multi-tasker, so stop it.</p>

          <p>So today is actually looped in with "yesterday's". I spent waaaay too much time trying to figure out the timeline. See Day 6 for more details.</p>

          <p>Timeline, you and I had words today. And even now, you're still not behaving. But it's cool, Imma let you have today. Tomorrow, it's on. I'm letting today count as 2 days since I spent more than double the usual time trying to figure out this dumb timeline.</p>
