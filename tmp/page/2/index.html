          </h2>
          <p>So today I installed the Middleman blogging gem. And woah, buddy do I have a lot to learn. I was pretty overwhelmed once I saw all the Ruby files that it created. I spent the hour picking through the files trying to understand what's there and how it's all linked together, but I'm still pretty confused. I left the site pretty unkept today, so I didn't end up deploying to Heroku today, but you can see the changes on Github. To be continued…</p>

          <p>I owned the timeline today! Man, it felt good. Today I worked from the <a href="http://2016.leanuxnyc.co/">Lean UX conference</a> in NYC. Such a great venue. Although, I've gotta admit, it's hard trying to code and listen at the same time. Note to self: you're not a good multi-tasker, so stop it.</p>

          <p>So today is actually looped in with "yesterday's". I spent waaaay too much time trying to figure out the timeline. See Day 6 for more details.</p>

          <p>Timeline, you and I had words today. And even now, you're still not behaving. But it's cool, Imma let you have today. Tomorrow, it's on. I'm letting today count as 2 days since I spent more than double the usual time trying to figure out this dumb timeline.</p>

          <p>I added a little header with some information about me. I also added a ReadMe so that anyone finding me on Github would have some idea of what I'm trying to do here. By the way, if you have zero things to do and want to see the code pre-processor code to this site, check out my <a href="http://bit.ly/ambergithub">Github</a>.</p>

          <p>So, I'm playing a little bit of catch up here. <a href="http://beonespark.com">One Spark</a> through a wrench in my week. But! I'm gonna do two sessions a day for the next two days to get caught up.</p>
          
          <p>Day 4 was about adding a nav bar and a few other tweaks.</p>

          <p>Man, do you have any idea how hard it is to not dive into the design right now? Do you know how hard it is for me to post this even though the design is no where near ready to show? But hey, that's what this exercise is about, right?</p>
          
          <p>Today I started applying Neat and Bitters and adding some custom styles.</p>

          <p>Today won't look like much, but the work is there. I created the project with Middleman, added it to Github, pushed it live on Heroku, and installed Bourbon, Neat, and Bitters. This will give me the structure that I need for the next 100 days. Pow.</p>
