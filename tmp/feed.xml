    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yes! ERB to HAML complete! It's amazing how one little misplaced comma or wrong indentation can ruin it all. Aaaaand, I also learned… when in doubt, bounce dat server!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welp, Danilo helped me figure out what was causing the error with my footer conversion from ERB to HAML: a comma. One measly comma. But honestly, I was pretty damn proud of myself that I got that close on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AND THEN… emboldened by my near success, I took on the layout.erb file and tried to convert it to HAML. Stuck again! This time, when I consulted the converter and copied and pasted in that code, it still didn't work! Grrrr. To be continued…&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I tried to convert some footer code from Ruby to HAML. I got so so close. But still no cigar. I'll figure it out soon. I'm actually really proud of myself for getting this far. I didn't use a converter or anything! I read the HAML docs and tried to figure it out on my own. 90% there… (I did try a converter after I kept getting an error 100 times trying different things, but it didn't really tell me anything I hadn't already figured out.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday my coworker Jimmy helped me understand Ruby a little better. He also helped me understand why my nested layouts weren't working: it WAS working, just not on the page I was expecting it to work on. Derp.&lt;/p&gt;
