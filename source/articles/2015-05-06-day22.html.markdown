    // Buttons
    %button.clean
      %i.fa.fa-long-arrow-left
      = link_to 'Previous', prev_page
    %button.clean
      = link_to 'Next', next_page
      %i.fa.fa-long-arrow-right

Today I styled the next and previous buttons at the bottom of the page. I also added Font Awesome for icons. I need to find out if there's a way to inject HAML into Markdown. If there's not, I may need to start writing these article pages in HAML.
