Man, it feels good to be back in the code. I'm ashamed to say that I haven't touched this project in a few weeks. But now it's on.

Today I started refactoring my Sass. I realized I was overusing indentation making everything waaaay more specific than it needs to be. I knocked out a lot today. But I'll need to finish it up tomorrow.
