Today my awesome coworker [Jimmy Thai](http://cronfu.com/) helped me get to the bottom of my Heroku issue. One major reason for the errors was that I had forgotten to add _  before some of my partial Sass files. That was making the code run twice and was causing an undefined variable error. Noted! 

He also explained that Heroku wasn't really the best home for a static site like this. So, we moved my site over to Github pages.
