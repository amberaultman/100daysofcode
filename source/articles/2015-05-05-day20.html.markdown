I forgot to add this blog post on Saturday...

Today I added a header and started styling the nav and footers. Not much style, but I started thinking about things and getting stuff organized. I also better organized my CSS. For some reason it appears that when I merged my day-20 branch in Github, it reverted some of my changes. Weird. Adding them back in now. I need to figure out what happened with that...
