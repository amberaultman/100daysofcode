So today I started making the transition from coding just a blog to coding a portfolio website for myself. I have a long way to go, but today started with adding a "sub nav". This "sub nav" will actually be a filter of the main timeline, allowing visitors to search through my work/case studies, Dribbble posts, Somewhere posts, and articles. Oh man, so much work to do.
