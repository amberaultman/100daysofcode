Last night I finally launched the Taverna website!! Hallelujah. You can check it out at http://taverna.restaurant. Super excited to get that off my plate so that I can get down to business with this site.

So in preparation for launch, I added Google Analytics to the site and went into cPanel to point the old URL to the new site. Oh yeah, boys.
