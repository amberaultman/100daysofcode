(Forgot to post create this article yesterday.)

Today I played around with the box-sizing model to get my borders to line up properly on my nav bar. I'd never messed with that before! Pretty cool.

I also started implementing Isotope, a jQuery library for creating a fluid, tiled grid system. I wasn't able to get it working, but I'll work on it again tomorrow!
