(I wasn't able to add this yesterday because of some versioning issues.)

Welp, today was one of those frustrating days. I was trying to install a work project locally and it brought on a whole mess of problems. I basically spent a large part of the afternoon with a coworker trying to figure out the problem which ultimately meant reinstalling ruby on my computer. Which also meant reinstalling rails and middleman. And I just opened it up to start my 100 days project only to get more errors. Grrrrrrrr. TBC...

(So Danilo helped me fix my version issues this morning and now I'm good to go!)
